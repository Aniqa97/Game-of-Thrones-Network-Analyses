# Game-of-Thrones-Network-Analyses


Game of Thrones is the hugely popular television series by HBO based on the (also) hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. 
In this notebook, we will analyze the co-occurrence network of the characters in the Game of Thrones books. 
Here, two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books
